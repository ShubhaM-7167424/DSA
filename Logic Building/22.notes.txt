example with n=36

Factors of 36 :  1*36, 2*18, 3*12, 4*9, 6*6

Notice how the factors pair off. The smaller factor in each pair is always
less than or equal to âˆš36 = 6.

Once we check divisibility up to 6, we have implicitly checked all possible pairs.
If no factor is found up to 6, no factors exist.

****************************************************************************

Example with n = 37 (a prime number):

If n = 37, Math.sqrt(37) is approximately 6.08, so we only need to check divisibility up to 6.

We check 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Since none of these divide 37, we can conclude that 37 is prime,
without needing to check numbers greater than 6.
